dotfiles
========

It's trendy to have a dotfiles repository nowadays.

This will contain personal configuration files and such.

install.sh
----------

This will copy all my dotfiles over into their rightful locations.

It will not overwrite existing files without overwriting, other than
files in the pomfclip repository if that is checked out.

render-m4
---------

Used to render a single m4 file from the dotfiles repository.
Good if you want to grab a single file without committing to using my
entire repository.
