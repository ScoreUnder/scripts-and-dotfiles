# Find the next matching executable in $PATH corresponding to the given name.
# If the given name is not in $PATH, then use command -v to find it.
# This allows you to write a wrapper script that calls the original executable
# without hardcoding its path, relying only on $0.
# Usage: next-in-path <path>
# Example: next-in-path /usr/local/bin/git
# (The example might print out "/usr/bin/git" if that's the next git in $PATH.)
